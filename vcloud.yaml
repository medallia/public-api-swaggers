      an audio file from which V-Cloud will download the audio data.
  - name: Results Request
    description:
      The `/transcribe/result` endpoint accepts `GET` requests that contain
      the `requestid` and `token` associated with the results being queried. 
  - name: Status Request
    description:
      The `/status` endpoint accepts `GET` requests and returns the status if 
      V-Cloud is operational.

        Retrieve transcription results using a valid `requestid` and `token`.
        The format of your results depend on the options specified in the 
        initial `/transcribe` request. Generally, `/transcribe` request 
        options that produce more than one file contain the results in 
        a ZIP file.

            also supports HTTP authorization request headers by including 
            the authorization header, authorization type, and access credentials 
            in the request.
